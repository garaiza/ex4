USB – Very important. I use it to carry around files that can’t be uploaded to Google Drive. Always have it with my keys so I don’t forget it at home. It

Kleenix- I tend to get sick when there are drastic weather changes so I wals try to keep some tissues with me. I sometimes even use them as napkins when I forget some at home

Watch- This is my old watch that I got in order to time myself when taking midterms. I got it at Target and it still works even though I can’t wear it anymore

Copic- I like to draw and I have been practicing using Copic markers.  I don’t use them as much anymore, but I forgot to take it out of my pencil case.

Wallet- This is the wallet that my mom bought me for my birthday. I really like the design on the front as well as it having a lot of slots and places to put your coins.
